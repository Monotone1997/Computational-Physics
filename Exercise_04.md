 Consider again a decay problem with two types of nuclei of type A into ones of type B, while nuclei of type B, while nuclei of type
B decay into ones of type A. Strictly speaking, this is not a "decay" process,since it is possible for the type B nuclei to turn back
into type A nuclei. A better analogy would be a resonance in which a system can tunnel or move back and forth between two states A and
B which have equal energies. The corresponding rate equations are (1.12)<br/>

where for simplicity we have assumed that the two types of decay are characterized by the same time constant,τ. Solve this system of 
equatiions for the numbers of nuclei, NA=100, NB=0, etc., and take τ=1s. Show that your numercial results are consistent with the idea
that the system reaches a steady state in which NA and NB are constant. In such a steady state, the time derivatives dNA/dt and dNB/dt
should vanish.
